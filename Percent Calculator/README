## Percent Calculator

This is a very simple code used to calculate the percentage of one number over another.

### Inputs
The code uses the *input* function to ask the user for dividend and divisor values.
The script then divides the two numbers, multiplies by 100, and displays the percent.

### Outputs
The code releases a single output: a numeric value showing the percent of the dividend divided by the divisor.

### Errors
The code checks if the divisor is zero, and if it is, the code stops running and an Error message is displayed.
