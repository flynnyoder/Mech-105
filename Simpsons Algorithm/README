## Simpson's Algorithm

This code uses *Simpson's 1/3 rule* and if necessary, one iteration of the *trapezoidal rule* to estimate the area under a graph. 
The graph s input by the user in vector form.

### Inputs
The function requires an X and Y vector, with the x values equally spaced. 
The functioon will display errors if more or less that two vectors are input, or if the X values aren't equally spaced. 
If the X and Y vectors aren't equal in length, the function will display an error.

### Outputs
The function outputs a number telling the user what the approximate area under their curve is.
The function also warns the user if the trapezoidal rule has been used in the calculation.
